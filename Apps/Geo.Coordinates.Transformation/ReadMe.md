# Coordinates Transform

The code begins by defining the source and destination Spatial Reference Systems (SRS). It creates SRS objects for UTM Zone 32 North and WGS84 using EPSG codes.

Then, a transformation object is created using the source and destination SRS. This transformation enables the conversion from UTM coordinates to latitude and longitude coordinates.

Next, a UTM point object is created with specific easting and northing coordinates.

The transformation object is used to convert the UTM point to a geographic point, represented by longitude and latitude.

Finally, the code outputs the UTM easting value, UTM northing value, longitude, and latitude, appending them to the output string.

In summary, the code performs a coordinate transformation from UTM Zone 32 North to latitude and longitude.
It converts a UTM point to its corresponding geographic point using the defined SRS and transformation. The resulting UTM easting, UTM northing, longitude, and latitude values are then displayed.
