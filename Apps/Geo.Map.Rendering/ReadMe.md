# Map Rendering

The code performs the following actions:

1. It determines an available file name by appending a number to a base file name until a file with that name does not exist.

2. It creates a collection of different geometries, including a point, a line, and a polygon.

3. It defines colors for each geometry.

4. It creates an in-memory layer to map each geometry with its respective color. The layer has an attribute named "Color" of type Integer.

5. It loops through the geometries and creates a feature for each geometry. The feature is assigned the corresponding color value and geometry, and then added to the layer.

6. It creates a new map instance with a specified size and padding.

7. It sets up different symbolizers (pointSymbolizer, lineSymbolizer, and polygonSymbolizer) to configure the rendering appearance based on the "Color" attribute value of each feature.

8. It adds the layer to the map, along with the symbolizers, to define how each geometry should be represented.

9. It renders the map to a file with the available file name and specified file extension.

10. It returns the name of the rendered file.

In summary, the code creates a map with different geometries and their associated colors. It renders the map to an image file and returns the file name. The code essentially renders a collection of geometries with custom colors to an image using the Aspose.Gis library.
