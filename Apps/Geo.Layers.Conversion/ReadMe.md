# Layers Conversion

The code performs a conversion from GeoJSON to KML format. It initializes an output string and appends a "START" message to it. Then, it converts a GeoJSON file to KML using specific drivers. The resulting KML content is appended to the output string. Finally, the code appends an "OK" message to the output string and returns it as the final result.
Overall, the code converts data from one format to another and generates an output string with relevant information.
