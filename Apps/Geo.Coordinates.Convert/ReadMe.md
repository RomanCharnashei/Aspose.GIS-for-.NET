# Coordinates Convert

The given code represents a class called ProjectPresenter, which contains a method called ConverAndReport(). This method utilizes the Aspose.Gis library to convert geographic coordinates and generate an output string with the results.

The method performs the following operations:

- The method then calls the GeoConvert.AsPointText() method, which is part of the Aspose.Gis library, to convert the given latitude (25.5) and longitude (45.5) coordinates into various mapping formats. It makes use of different format options available in the library.

The conversion is done for the following formats:

- Decimal Degrees (DD) format: The coordinates are converted to decimal degrees using the PointFormats.DecimalDegrees format option.

- Degrees Decimal Minutes (DDM) format: The coordinates are converted to degrees and decimal minutes using the PointFormats.DegreeDecimalMinutes format option.

- Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) format: The coordinates are converted to degrees, minutes, and seconds using the PointFormats.DegreeMinutesSeconds format option.

- GeoRef format: The coordinates are converted to the World Geographic Reference System format using the PointFormats.GeoRef format option.

- Mgrs format: The coordinates are converted to the Military Grid Reference System format using the PointFormats.Mgrs format option.

- Usng format: The coordinates are converted to the United States National Grid format using the PointFormats.Usng format option.

For each conversion format, the result is appended to the output string with the corresponding format label.

- The method returns the string representation of the output string, which contains the conversion results in various mapping formats.

Therefore, the ConverAndReport() method converts the given geographic coordinates (25.5, 45.5) into multiple mapping formats, adds the results to the output string, and returns a string with the conversion results. The supported formats include Decimal Degrees (DD), Degrees Decimal Minutes (DDM), Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS), GeoRef, Mgrs, and Usng.
